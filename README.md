# Webserve

This is a project that stated from a friendly challenge between another friend.
He built a webserver in python, I built one in C because I hate having free time.

I have learned that it is more fun to write a webserver in python, but mine is still faster js.
As for security, that is a different discussion.

I am continually developing this very small http server to have more features.
